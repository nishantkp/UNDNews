# UNDNews - A news app

Project as a part of nano-degree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com).

### Project Rubic

The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.

#### Helpers :smiley:

- Guardugn API
- JSON
- Web Intent
- Exception handeling
- AsynckTask
- Network call on background thread
- Swipe list view to refresh
- ViewHolder
- Uri builder
- Gradient drawable
- Navigation drawer
- Shared preference

#### New class

Returns a string describing 'time' as a time relative to 'now'.
Time spans in the past are formatted like "42 minutes ago". Time spans in the future are formatted like "In 42 minutes".
```java
DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString (long time, long now, long minResolution, int flags);
```

#### SwipeRefreshLayout Widget

The following example demonstrates how to add the SwipeRefreshLayout widget to an existing layout file containing a ListView:
[developer.android link](https://developer.android.com/training/swipe/add-swipe-interface.html)

```xml
<android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/swiperefresh"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <ListView
        android:id="@android:id/list"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" />

</android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout>
```

#### URI builder

Let's say that I want to create the following URL:

`https://www.myawesomesite.com/turtles/types?type=1&sort=relevance#section-name`

To build this with the `Uri.Builder`, following should be done.
Refere this [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19167954/use-uri-builder-in-android-or-create-url-with-variables/19168199#19168199) post.
```java
Uri.Builder builder = new Uri.Builder();
builder.scheme("https")
    .authority("www.myawesomesite.com")
    .appendPath("turtles")
    .appendPath("types")
    .appendQueryParameter("type", "1")
    .appendQueryParameter("sort", "relevance")
    .fragment("section-name");
String myUrl = builder.build().toString();
```

#### API

Well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format.<br />
